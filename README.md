## **Description (Motivation? The why? Solved Problems?)**
      
  This project functions as a backend to a social networking app.  The client is able to perform a multitude of CRUD operations by hitting routes into the database in MongoDB.  You can Get all users and thoughts(same as a post or status), Get a single thought or user by id, update thoughts and users, as well as delete thoughts and users.  Once can go a step further and add/remove friends and add/remove reactions to another user's thought.

## **Installation <a id="installation"></a>**
  
  Move your current directory into the package.json files to see what dependencies you will need and run 'npm i'.  This will install mongoose, moment, and express packages. After those are done installing run nodemon index.js in the terminal to start your local server.  Then head over to insomnia and try out some of the routes in order to seed or edit the database.
